## Install

*Requirements*

Node / NPM

Bower (Package Manager)

```
npm install bower -g
```

Inside your project run:

```
bower install x-tag-growbox
```

This downloads the component and dependencies to ./components



## About

Growbox resizes when the inner content changes sizes.  It's perfect for content that changes size and you don't want to have to resize the parent element.

## Usage

```
	<x-growbox id="growbox">
		<h1>HI</h1>
		<p>Some content</p>
	</x-growbox>
```
